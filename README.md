# M2OST: Many-to-one Regression for Predicting Spatial Transcriptomics from Digital Pathology Images

This is the official repository for AAAI 2025 paper *M2OST: Many-to-one Regression for Predicting Spatial Transcriptomics from Digital Pathology Images*

The code of the core M2OST network will be released shortly after in a torch.nn.Module style, while the complete training/validation code will be updated after a comprehensive sweep. Thank you for your interest in our work.

## Update 2025/04/16

Sorry for the late release. As I have finished my diseertatioon today, all the related codes are going to be released very soon. Right now a roughly updated version have been pushed, but please note that the pretrained weights are not verified yet and they may be from my previous project (see [M2ORT]()). I will soon check all the weights and only keep the ones that can fit M2OST.
